# TFTP server

A simple tftp server written in C

feature list:

 * Downloads from server
 * Upload requests are ignored
 * Support simultaneous requests (using threading)
 * otherwise fully compatible with [RFC 1350](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt)

how to build:
run 'make' within the 'src/' directory
or run 'make -C ./src' within the pa1/ directory

how to start server:

```
$ ./tftp <port> <directory>
```
all other signatures will cause errors

### Code structure:

The main logic of the program can be found in 'tftpd.c' but extra files are also included

 * 'types_and_constants.' is to keep const values and typedefs that are used throughout the project
 * 'file_util.c' contains utility functions for easier file opening, closing and reading (with added safety checks)

Packets are implemented as char of size PACKET_SIZE = 516

If filename contains a path, only the first directory is used

-Mode strings can be "mail", "octet" and "netascii".

"mail" mode means that netascii characters are sent to user rather than a file, 
but this mode is obsolete and was not implemented

"octet" mode means that data is transferred and stored exactly as is,
this was therefore not implemented

"netascii" mode means that it is assumed that a text file is being sent,
a host which receives netascii mode data must translate the data to its own format.
In RFC 764 it says:
	the sequence "CR LF" must be treated as a single "new line" character 
		and used whenever their combined action is intended; 
	the sequence "CR NUL" must be used where a carriage return alone is
		 actually desired; 
	and the CR character must be avoided in other contexts.
the function mode_netascii therefore replaces all LF(\n) with CR LF (\r\n) and 
all CR (\r) with CR NUL (\r\0)

-Server does not accept WRQ packets, that is, attempts of uploading files are handled
by sending an error packet
