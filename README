# TFTP server

A simple tftp server written in C

feature list:

 * Downloads from server
 * Upload requests are ignored
 * Support simultaneous requests (using threading)
 * otherwise fully compatible with [RFC 1350](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt)

how to build:
run `make` within the `src/` directory

how to start server:

```
$ ./tftp <port> <directory>
```
all other signatures will cause errors

### Code structure:

The main logic of the program can be found in `tftpd.c` but extra files are also included

 * `types_and_constants.h` is to keep const values and typedefs that are used throughout the project
 * `file_util.c` contains utility functions for easier file opening, closing and reading (with added safety checks)
